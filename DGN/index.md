# Knowledge-Driven Visual Target Navigation: Dual Graph Navigation

## Author

### Abstract

Visual target navigation is a critical task within the realm of embodied intelligence. Existing end-to-end and modular approaches often face high computational demands, challenges in online updates, and limited generalization, restricting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a knowledge-driven, lightweight image instance navigation framework, Dual Graph Navigation (DGN).

### Introduction

Visual navigation in unknown environments is a core challenge in the field of embodied intelligence. It requires robots to possess both scene understanding and autonomous navigation capabilities. Complex indoor environments impose strict requirements on a robotâ€™s real-time navigation abilities.

### Method

To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a knowledge-driven lightweight image instance navigation framework, the Dual Graph Navigation (DGN), as illustrated in the following sections.


### Results

DGN outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate and path efficiency, demonstrating strong generalization and adaptability across different environments.

### Conclusion

The DGN framework provides an efficient and adaptable solution for visual target navigation on resource-constrained devices, leveraging dual-topological perception to guide exploration and decision-making.
